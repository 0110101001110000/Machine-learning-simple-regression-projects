# Machine-learning-simple-regression-projects

Welcome to the *Machine-learning-simple-regression-projects* repository!
Below, there's a simple tutorial to help you run this project on your machine!

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)

## Clone the Repository

To clone this repository to your local machine, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0110101001110000/Machine-learning-simple-regression-projects/
```

## Installing Required Python Libraries

To simplify the installation of the required Python libraries, a `requirements.txt` file is included in this repository. This file lists all the necessary dependencies.

To install all the required libraries, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have `pip` installed with Python. It's usually included with most Python installations.

2. Navigate into the project directory using the cd command:

```bash
cd Machine-learning-simple-regression-projects
```

3. Run the following command to install all the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Code

After installing the required libraries, choose a project to run:

```bash
cd project-name
```

Replace project-name with the name of the project that you want to run.

Once you're inside the project directory, you can run the Python code using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will execute the main.py file located in the project directory.
